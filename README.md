# fake-news-detection
A project to detect fake news using Logistic Regression and LSTM models with sentiment analysis to combat misinformation.
# Fake News Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust model for detecting fake news articles using various machine learning techniques. With the rise of misinformation, it's crucial to accurately identify and categorize news articles as real or fake. This project utilizes both Logistic Regression and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models enhanced by sentiment analysis to achieve this goal.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of news articles labeled as fake or real. Key features of the dataset include:

- **Title**: The headline of the news article.
- **Text**: The full text of the news article.
- **Label**: Indicates whether the article is "fake" or "real".

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NLTK or SpaCy for text processing
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
  - Keras/TensorFlow for LSTM model implementation
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Used to enhance the feature set for better prediction accuracy.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered news articles from various online sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical format.
4. **Model Training**: 
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model and an LSTM model using the processed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Project Insights
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of XX%.
- The LSTM model demonstrated improved performance, especially in classifying longer articles.
- Sentiment analysis contributed positively to the model's ability to discern fake news.

## Future Enhancements
- Explore additional NLP techniques for better feature extraction.
- Implement ensemble methods to combine multiple model predictions for improved accuracy.
- Create a web interface for users to input articles for real-time fake news detection.
